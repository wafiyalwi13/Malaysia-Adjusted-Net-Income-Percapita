# Malaysia Adjusted Net Income Per Capita

## Intro
This data was extracted from and cleaned from World Bank websites, which portrayed the net income per capita for Malaysia from 1970-2020 (50 Years).
Using that data I try to forecast the Net Income Per Capita for year 2021  using the past data (1970-2020)
